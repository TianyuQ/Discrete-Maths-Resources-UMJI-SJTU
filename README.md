During my Undergraduate in UM-SJTU Joint Institute, I worked as a teaching assistant for the course Discrete Maths lectured by Prof. Zach Mckenzie in the 2019 Summer Semester and Prof. Heidi Anderson in the 2020 Summer Semester, respectively. I was nominated as an outstanding teaching assistant then. 

This repo is the collection of slides used in my recitation classes and exam reviews.
